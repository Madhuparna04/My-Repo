This repository contains code for commonly used algorithms in Competitive Programming contests.
All the implementations are tested in various CP platforms for time-complexity correctness and
general correctness of the algorithm.

1. Binary Search tree.

2. Dijkstra with adjacency list representation of the graph.

3. Disjoint set union (DSU).

4. Hashing with chaining and delete operation.

5. Kruskal's algorithm for Minimum spanning tree.

6. Max heap.

7. Merge sort with counting inversions.

8. Hashing using open addressing.

9. Segment trees - minimum and maximum query.

10. Square root decomposition.
